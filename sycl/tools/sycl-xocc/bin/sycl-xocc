# This is an extra layer of abstraction on top of the shell invocing the
# SDx compiler. As SPIR/LLVM-IR is a second class citizen in SDx for the
# moment it has some little niggling details that need worked on and the idea
# is that this script will work around those with some aid from Clang/LLVM.
#
# One of the main examples is that SDx can only compile one kernel from LLVM-BC
# at a time and it requires the kernels name (also required for kernel specific
# optimizations). This poses a problem as there can be multiple kernels in a
# file. And when making a normal naked SDx -c command in the driver
# you won't have the neccesarry information as the command is generated before
# the file's have even started to be compiled (Perhaps there is that I am
# unaware of). So no kernel names and no idea how many SDx commands you'd need
# to generate per file (no idea how many kernels are in a file).
#
# This works around that by using an opt (kernelNameGen) pass that generates
# an intermediate file with the needed information that we eat up and can then
# loop over each kernel in a file. It's simple at the moment just kernel names,
# but could expand in the future to include optimization information for each
# kernel.
#
# Arguments:
# $1 == SDx's SDx bin directory where the real shell invocation that invokes
#       the SDx compiler resides
# $2 == path to the clang driver that's executing the shell script (e.g.
#        your compiled Clang's build/bin)
# $3 == The name of the source file without file extensions or temporary
#       manglings, mostly used to generate some intermediate file names
# $4 == The initial input file name, currently a .o file that's actually a .bc
#       file in disguise
# $5 == The systems temporary directory where we'll deposit some intermediate
#       files
# $6 == The name we wish to give our final output .xcl binary, important that it
#       is consistent with what the driver expects it to be.

# TODO: Pass an argument through the driver to set options like XILINX_PLATFORM,
# the environment variables are a quick workaround to swap boards.
