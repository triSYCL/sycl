# Getting started with Vitis IP block design with an AMD FPGA

Disclaimer: nothing here is supported and this is all about a research
project.

This describes the C++20 non-single source Vitis IP mode compilation
flow used to generate Vitis IP which can be used later into Vivado for
further integration in a project.

This uses some features developed for the SYCL compiler to provide
something similar to HLS C++ but with more modern C++20.

We assume that you are on a recent Linux `x86_64` machine. with a
recent C++ compiler, `python3` and Vitis/Vivado already installed.


## Compile the compiler

Building the compiler can be done with Python scripts:

```bash
# Pick some place where the compiler has to be compiled, such as:
DPCPP_HOME=~/sycl_workspace
mkdir $DPCPP_HOME
cd $DPCPP_HOME
# You can also try --branch sycl/unified/next for a bleeding edge experience
git clone --branch sycl/unified/master https://github.com/triSYCL/sycl llvm
# Minimum configuration, but you can add more
python $DPCPP_HOME/llvm/buildbot/configure.py
# Compile only the minimum for Vitis IP support. If you compile for
# the full SYCL support, it will work too but the compilation of the
# tool is slower.
python $DPCPP_HOME/llvm/buildbot/compile.py --build-target vitis-ip-compiler
```


## Environnement Setup

The requirements for environment setup is that there is a `vitis_hls` in
the `PATH` and the libraries shipped with Vitis are in the
`LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.

if you already have a setup for this you can use it.

Otherwise you will need to make a setup.sh script like this:
```bash
# The place where SYCL has been compiled:
DPCPP_HOME=~/sycl_workspace
# Fill the version
XILINX_VERSION=2022.1
# Where all the AMD/Xilinx tools are
XILINX_ROOT=/opt/xilinx
# Where the SYCL compiler binaries are:
SYCL_BIN_DIR=$DPCPP_HOME/llvm/build/bin
XILINX_VITIS_HLS=$XILINX_ROOT/Vitis_HLS/$XILINX_VERSION
XILINX_VIVADO=$XILINX_ROOT/Vivado/$XILINX_VERSION
# Add the various tools in the PATH
PATH=$PATH:$SYCL_BIN_DIR:$XILINX_VITIS_HLS/bin
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$XILINX_VITIS_HLS/lib/lnx64.o:$DPCPP_HOME/llvm/build/lib
```


### Small examples

The minimal file
`$DPCPP_HOME/llvm/sycl/test/vitis/simple_tests/vitis_ip_export.cpp`
containing

```cpp
// __VITIS_KERNEL marks the top-level kernel function
__VITIS_KERNEL int test(int a, int b) {
  return a + b;
}
```
can be used as an example.

It can be compiled with

```bash
# Be sure to use the right clang++
SYCL_VXX_KEEP_CLUTTER=1 $SYCL_BIN_DIR/clang++ --target=vitis_ip-xilinx $DPCPP_HOME/llvm/sycl/test/vitis/simple_tests/vitis_ip_export.cpp --vitis-ip-part=xcu200-fsgd2104-2-e -o adder.zip
```

where `--target=vitis_ip-xilinx` specifies that we are targeting Vitis
IP blocks and `--vitis-ip-part=xcu200-fsgd2104-2-e` specifies for
example the part `xcu200-fsgd2104-2-e` which is used in the Alveo U200
Board, which can obviously replaced by what you are really working
with. But be careful to use only a part you have a license for,
otherwise it will fail. Look for example at
`/opt/xilinx/Vivado/2022.1/data/parts/installed_devices.txt` to have
an idea of what is available.

The output is a Vivado IP `zip` archive that can be loaded into Vivado
when making a block design.
